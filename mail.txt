2. Adding .Model file:
-> This feature is already implemented by you in command line interface mode. Now you need to do it GUI based.
-> Functionality for creating new model also needs to be implemented. This is already done by yogesh. check newmodel.py for same. you need to incorporate this in your python code.

3. Analysis and control command:
-> This feature is also implemented by you in command line interface mode.But there are some bugs in that. We have reported it on Github.
   Please address those issues before implementing GUI for this.
-> For transient analysis using transistor netlist I have attached as an example file.
-> For AC analysis you can use RC differentiator circuit I have mailed you earlier.
